CSS-LOGOS

This page show some recreations of famouse tech logos using CSS
also this logos show some animations when you hover on them.

Another feature of this exercise is that you can see the CSS code for
each logo, each one has its dedicated page where you can see the code and
tweak it in real time.

I also implemented react-router-dom library to create a singlepage aplication
for the various pages for each logo.
