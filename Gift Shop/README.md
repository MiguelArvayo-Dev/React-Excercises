Gift Shop

This excercise we create and online shop with a shop cart to add the items from
the shop

This excercise uses:

useReducer - to control de shop cart state in a modular function separated from the react component state
useContext - to avoid prop drilling information (like fitler values) from parent components
custom hooks - to control the filters like price and categories indepently
useId hook - to create unique id's for the key of elements in the dom
local storage - to keep the item in the shop cart in cache even after refreshing or closing the page
